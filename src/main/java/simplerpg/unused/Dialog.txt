"Stepping into the thick forest, you think how"
	"dangerous it could be if there were monsters in"
	"this valley. Thankfully, they don't exist yet. ";

"You are surrounded by trees";

"Gazing upon the steep cliff walls and frosted mountain"
	"tops you realize you are not equipped to survive the"
	"climb. You turn back with regret.";

"The water here looks deep and you doubt you could reach the other side.";

"A wall stands before you. You'll have to find another way.";

"You see a shiny object half-obscured by dirt."
	"Upon closer examination you recognize it as"
	"an [ITEM]; you pocket it.";	
"You see a shiny object half-obscured by dirt."
	"Upon closer examination you realize it's just unwritten code.";

" You wake to find yourself in a trampled clearing, a few embers"
	"of last night's fire still glowing dully beside you. As you look"

"Reluctantly, you leave your bedroll and begin breaking camp. A"
