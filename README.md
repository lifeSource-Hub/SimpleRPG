This is a work-in-progress RPG game. I am developing this to gain 
experience and for my own enjoyment.

### Project Status ###

There is very little that a user can actually do at this point, other 
than move around. My current goal is to get a basic combat system 
working as soon as possible.

### Upcoming Features ###

* Combat System
* Items and Inventory
* Dialog

### Controls ###

The arrow keys are bound to the movement buttons.
