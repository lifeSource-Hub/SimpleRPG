# SimpleRPG #

This is a work-in-progress RPG game. I am developing this to gain 
experience and for my own enjoyment.

### Project Status ###

There is very little that a user can actually do at this point, other 
than move around. Much of my time (perhaps too much) has been spent 
designed and refactoring, rather than adding new content. My current 
goal is to get a basic combat system working as soon as possible.

### Upcoming Features ###

* Combat System
* Items and Inventory
* Dialog
